# App Virality *Beta*
Tools to help your android app go viral.

**Warning:** This is very early version, use at your own risk!

# Tools

**1. Rating & feedback**, mimics the behaviour as described in this [blog post by Circa](https://medium.com/circa/the-right-way-to-ask-users-to-review-your-app-9a32fd604fca#.dk4uq4jm7).

It should help you get better ratings and build a better app, using the following elements:
- Dialog
- Embedded View
- Recyclerview adapter

**More coming soon**
